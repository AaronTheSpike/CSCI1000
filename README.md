# CSCI1000 Group Project

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of the CSCI1000 course to learn how to use GitHub for collaborative software development. The focus of this assignment was on understanding the basics of version control, working with branches, and managing group contributions through commits and pull requests.

## Objective
Our main goal was to practice using GitHub as a team while writing simple C++ programs. This project helped us understand how to share code, resolve merge conflicts, and document our progress effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Version Control Platform:** GitHub

## Contributors
- **Aaron Ashenbrener**  
- **Vishnu [Last Name]**  
- **Liam [Last Name]**

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, our group learned how to:
- Create and clone repositories  
- Use branches for separate development  
- Commit and merge code changes  
- Collaborate efficiently using GitHub features  

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to our instructor and peers for their guidance throughout this learning process.
